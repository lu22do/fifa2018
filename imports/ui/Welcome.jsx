        <h4>Goal</h4>
        <p>
        The goal of the game is to get your team selections accumulate the
        highest number of points by the end of the FIFA 2018 Worldcup.
        </p>

        <br/>
        <h4>Rules</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>To create a selection, pick 1 team from each group by
          clicking on <Link to="/new-selection">New Selection</Link>.
          Groups were created following the FIFA ranking before the WC2018</li>
          <li>Each player can create up to 3 selections.</li>
          <li>How you get points:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Your teams will keep gaining points for you as long as they keep
            playing (not eliminated). Wins, draws and goals get you points.</li>
            <li>Each win gains your selection 3 points, each draw 1 point, each
            goal scored gains additional Y points (Y = 0.3 during group stage,
            0.5 during elimination phase)</li>
            <li>Penalty kicks are not accounted. Only the winner (3 points) and goals during regulation time from each side are counted for points</li>
          </ul>
          <li>After the competition kicks off, it is not possible to create/delete/replace a selection. Your selections can be done until June 14th 15:00 UTC, just before the opening game of FIFA 2018</li>
          <li>The player with most total points win. In case of a tie, all those folks win.</li>
        </ul>
